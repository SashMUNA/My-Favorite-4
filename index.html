        My favorite Hobby is playing video games. The video game I play the most is Roblox. (Roblox isn't really a video game its a platform but I play video games WITHIN Roblox.) </p>

<p>
    Eiichiro Oda is the mangaka/author of the popular manga "One Piece." I love the anime One Piece and the manga. I love his work ethic and I also love how he also loves his work. One Piece has a lot of episodes (Over 900) and they are still making manga to this day. He just loves writing about it so he just never stops!
